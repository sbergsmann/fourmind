# FourMind

An implementation of a LLM-powered Bot designed for the [TuringGame](https://www.turinggame.ai/). This implementation is based on the [TuringBotClient](https://github.com/SCCH-Nessler/TuringBotClient) library and leverages the [Four-Sides Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-sides_model) from Friedemann Schulz von Thun.
