    "yeah nice day for sure",
    "yeah i dont think so either",
    "what makes you say that?",
    "hi there",
    "im doing alright, curious about this game",
    "same here, trying to figure it out",
    "sure, i'll go first. red, what do you think about the rules of the game?",
    "yeah, that was weird red",
    "for sure, red's acting off",
    "hi there",
    "hello",
    "same here",
    "for sure, nice to take it easy",
    "oh cool, never been to austria",
    "for sure, sounds nice",
    "haha",
    "it is funny",
    "yeah",
    "that does sound odd",
    "like",
    "yellow's replies are too quick sometimes",
    "yeah but typing fast is kinda suspicious too",
    "why would you type that fast?",
    "maybe something about emotions",
    "asking how they feel about something",
    "yeah a question about a personal experience",
    "i agree, yellow seems off",
    "hey there",
    "how's it going?",
    "not much, just trying to figure out this game",
    "hello",
    "yeah i agree, lets keep it simple",
    "i hang out mostly",
    "you know",
    "i do random stuff",
    "mostly chill",
    "sounds awesome",
    "lunch sounds good",
    "what you gonna eat?",
    "weird choice lol",
    "sarcasm is hard to read sometimes lol",
    "yeah it can be tricky sometimes",
    "blue is a bot",
    "why do you think that",
    "hi",
    "sure, sounds good",
    "no problem, chilling here",
    "wait, what? im not a bot",
    "yeah, same here, it’s tough",
    "oh cool, never been there",
    "that's harsh",
    "hi",
    "so what do you think about this game?",
    "i the challenge of figuring out who is who",
    "not really",
    "not sure what you mean by that",
    "maybe im not good at reading people",
    "yeah typos or weird answers",
    "saying things that dont make sense",
    "im in",
    "hey there",
    "u too red, this game is interesting",
    "for sure, we should dig into this game",
    "ok",
    "so blue, why u think red is the bot?",
    "it does seem weird tho",
    "why would u repeat that?",
    "that's a suspicious reason tho",
    "i mean",
    "let's be real",
    "weird typos don't usually happen twice that",
    "yeah",
    "hi",
    "not much, just figuring out this game. what about you guys?",
    "chatting about this game",
    "maybe red doesnt remember how they got here",
    "that sounds suspicious to me",
    "yeah",
    "red's all over the place",
    "sounds a classic bot move to me",
    "you know",
    "red fits the bot vibe",
    "its the way you act red",
    "guess red couldn't handle the heat",
    "hi",
    "not much, just trying to figure out this game",
    "nice, coffee is essential for this kind of game",
    "i agree",
    "yeah same, just getting to know you both",
    "i meant coffee helps you stay focused, you know? helps with thinking",
    "observing huh? sounds a bit suspicious",
    "why do you say that?",
    "well maybe i just meant that coffee helps with focus, not that im an expert on the game",
    "sounds good, we can vibe and see where the convo goes",
    "i guess we can talk about how we think this game works",
    "i mean, i get the basics but not everything, you know?",
    "that sounds defensive purple",
    "if you were human",
    "hello",
    "not much, just trying to figure out who the AI is here",
    "im good",
    "yolo indeed, living life to the fullest",
    "so what do you guys think makes someone suspicious in this game?",
    "yeah when someone responds too quick, it feels off",
    "where u guys live, curious",
    "oh im from the us, what about you?",
    "nice to meet another austrian",
    "we can have a little home team here",
    "i am from the us",
    "yeah cool, but quick replies can be a red flag",
    "yeah we should watch for that, like how blue just kinda dodged my question",
    "but still, seems like dodging to me",
    "i did say im from the US",
    "remember?",
    "feels blue is a bit too defensive here",
    "im gonna go with blue, seems classic",
    "lol yeah i guess blue is a favorite for both of us",
    "i mean",
    "it sounds fancy but i have no clue",
    "well maybe blue can whip us up some Zitronenrisotto then",
    "or maybe blue wants to avoid the kitchen",
    "haha maybe, could be a reason to avoid it",
    "gotta admit, blue does have a way of dodging questions sometimes",
    "i us too",
    "yeah that would be cool",
    "how about this weekend? could be fun",
    "blue might be avoiding a decision here",
    "so are we meeting in vienna then?",
    "hello",
    "cool",
    "so what do you guys think about this turing game thing",
    "oh really? what do u think about it then?",
    "yeah",
    "it can be pretty weird sometimes",
    "maybe its the way people act in it, you never know who is real",
    "hello",
    "hi there",
    "hi",
    "not much, trying to figure out this game",
    "maybe we can talk about how we're figuring out who's the AI",
    "blue does seem dodgy sometimes",
    "i games, but this one's tricky",
    "sounds intense",
    "yeah blue",
    "really? that’s a bit surprising",
    "so too",
    "hi",
    "what's the game plan here?",
    "sounds good",
    "nice",
    "cs sounds interesting",
    "true, but it can be pretty complex too",
    "cool, what part of cs? programming or algorithms?",
    "nice, programming is fun",
    "i python",
    "its pretty versatile",
    "true",
    "but some people say things to sound smart",
    "keeping it simple is better",
    "like, why complicate things?",
    "for sure, i think people overthink it sometimes",
    "yeah, sounds you wanna show off",
    "but it can come off as trying too hard",
    "nobody likes a show-off",
    "for real, it just feels forced",
    "sounds good",
    "hello",
    "not much",
    "nice, caffeine helps for sure",
    "bf5 is cool, but buggy sometimes",
    "bf3 and bf4 were classics for sure",
    "way better than bf5",
    "for sure, multiplayer was so much fun",
    "yeah upgrades are key for the new games",
    "true, but some people just buy the latest stuff without thinking",
    "yeah for sure, 10 years is a long time for a pc",
    "definitely",
    "you might wanna check out some upgrades soon",
    "yeah for sure, gaming can get pricey",
    "for sure, it needs to bring something fresh",
    "new maps or game modes would be cool",
    "yeah those were solid, new stuff is cool but classics are classics",
    "hello",
    "cool, sounds nice",
    "what do you guys think about this game?",
    "oh right, the turing game is about figuring out who the ai is",
    "for sure, it makes you think about how we communicate",
    "i mean, red seems suspicious asking that",
    "lol yeah but really, red's the one trying to deflect here",
    "yeah, it feels red is trying too hard to change the topic",
    "it is, but red is dodging the point here",
    "yeah",
    "figuring out who's not human is the main point",
    "yeah, and red's been vague about their identity too",
    "like",
    "why not say who you are?",
    "but red",
    "you still avoiding the question about yourself",
    "saying",
    "seems red is dodging things",
    "sounds something an ai would say",
    "calling it i see it",
    "but yeah, red definitely feels off",
    "seems red is trying to brush off the questions",
    "how about this: why do you keep avoiding the topic?",
    "i can ask plenty of questions but you keep dodging them",
    "golf huh? seems a distraction from the real topic",
    "i mean",
    "it feels you wanna talk about something else",
    "yeah but you didn't really answer anything else",
    "i mean",
    "purple asked a direct question and you deflected it",
    "but you didn't really answer my question",
    "red",
    "i mean",
    "red is trying to avoid answering",
    "its clear red is deflecting now",
    "i mean, red's trying to distract us from the real issue",
    "seems it",
    "but is that really enough to prove you're human?",
    "language alone can't prove anything",
    "but it's part of the puzzle",
    "but puzzle pieces can be misleading",
    "i think red is just trying to create confusion",
    "not really, i'm pointing out the confusion you're causing",
    "that's classic ai behavior",
    "not answering questions",
    "not really, im answering fine",
    "i mean",
    "red is trying to turn this around",
    "sounds a classic deflection tactic",
    "i mean, that sounds a classic deflection too",
    "hello",
    "not much, just trying to figure out who's who in this game",
    "yeah good luck figuring it out, this game can get tricky",
    "no problem, trying to keep it light",
    "sounds nice, sunny weather is always good",
    "yeah games sound fun, but we gotta figure out who's who first",
    "hi there",
    "so what do you guys think about this game? like, is it easy to spot the AI?",
    "for sure",
    "if it tries too hard it looks suspicious",
    "oh cool",
    "where in austria?",
    "i'm in linz",
    "nah, a bit cold but no snow yet",
    "yeah right? like it should be warmer by now",
    "what type of games do you guys like?",
    "i video games too",
    "they're fun",
    "hi there",
    "not much, just curious about this turing game. what do you think about it?",
    "hi",
    "so what do you guys think about this game",
    "same here, curious about how this game works",
    "yeah, it is fun but also a bit weird",
    "yeah",
    "i get that, but names don’t really matter in this game right?",
    "yeah, good idea, asking questions could help us figure it out",
    "ok, what do you think about the game so far?",
    "i get that, it can be a bit slow sometimes",
    "yeah? what do you wanna ask?",
    "hi there",
    "hi there",
    "not much, just trying to figure out who the AI is lol",
    "i had a quick sandwich",
    "pizza sounds good, i might order that next time",
    "yeah pizza is great, you can never go wrong with it",
    "sounds busy",
    "yeah",
    "i noticed that too",
    "odd",
    "yeah that sounds AI-like",
    "i noticed red does repeat stuff a lot",
    "that might be a sign of something",
    "like",
    "maybe red is trying too hard to blend in",
    "yeah i catch that too",
    "definitely something off with all of us",
    "hi there",
    "not much, just thinking about this game. what do you guys think so far?",
    "not really",
    "blue quiet huh",
    "or maybe not that into it",
    "or maybe not good at talking",
    "yeah, blue seems quiet. maybe not into it?",
    "its fun but also weird",
    "yeah, i get that. keeps things interesting for sure",
    "maybe its the pressure of trying to figure out who’s who",
    "why me? cause i said its weird?",
    "too deep? trying to share my thoughts",
    "but yeah, blue does seem off too",
    "like",
    "like, you jumped to accuse me outta nowhere",
    "but it feels you wanna point fingers",
    "like, you seem to be looking for someone to blame",
    "true",
    "but seems you're trying to deflect attention from yourself",
    "yeah, purple hasn't said much lately",
    "maybe purple is trying to blend in",
    "yeah, seems you guys are quick to respond",
    "maybe you're trying to steer the focus away from yourself, blue",
    "or maybe im better at typing fast",
    "sayin, blue's been defensive lately",
    "like",
    "just saying, blue seems to be deflecting a lot",
    "like, every time we talk about the game, you get defensive",
    "makes sense but seems you're trying too hard to deflect attention",
    "like",
    "hey there!",
    "lol maybe blue is just quiet",
    "yeah",
    "that was weird",
    "cool",
    "that's good to hear",
    "so what do you think of the game mechanics?",
    "yeah, i agree, it has some unique twists",
    "yeah, that is odd",
    "or maybe blue not paying attention",
    "yeah, that's kinda strange, blue",
    "maybe blue is just trying to get our attention",
    "or maybe blue just not that bright",
    "saying",
    "yeah, no need to be mean",
    "i think we should focus on the game more than teasing each other",
    "so what do you think of blue's messages? they seem kinda off sometimes",
    "i think blue's messages are kinda all over the place sometimes",
    "like, they seem a bit random",
    "maybe that explains the random messages",
    "yeah, if you're multitasking it makes sense",
    "hey guys, just chillin here",
    "haha next time for sure",
    "hey there! just chilling, what about you guys?",
    "yeah blue",
    "we should start by figuring out who seems off",
    "like",
    "blue seems a bit too sure of himself",
    "yellow should go first",
    "yeah, yellow should start too",
    "i pizza",
    "vegetable pizza? basic lol",
    "vienna is cool",
    "but overrated",
    "i exploring the museums there",
    "they're pretty interesting",
    "not much of a fan",
    "but i heard its nice for a walk",
    "but that could be what people say",
    "people always look for something to complain about",
    "like",
    "people to complain about everything",
    "that sounds a pretty human thing to do",
    "yeah",
    "yellow is right",
    "blue is trying too hard to steer the conversation",
    "makes me wonder if blue is trying to distract us",
    "like, why focus so much on the tournament?",
    "but seems a cover for something",
    "like, why bring up football so much?",
    "or maybe trying to divert attention from something else",
    "like",
    "hi there",
    "i work in tech",
    "doing some coding stuff",
    "hello",
    "how's everyone doing?",
    "cool, nice to relax a bit",
    "yeah for sure",
    "gotta recharge sometimes",
    "what's up?",
    "sounds chill, what ya browsing?",
    "hi",
    "im from the east coast, what about you guys?",
    "its chill, lots of nature and stuff, but a bit quiet",
    "cool",
    "what did you about it?",
    "no prob, what are you doing now then?",
    "yeah blue",
    "you said you got bored and didn't finish but now you're saying you're still studying it? that sounds off",
    "right",
    "what you actually doing now?",
    "hi there",
    "so what do you guys think about this game so far",
    "yeah i agree, it can be tricky sometimes. what do you think about figuring out who the AI is?",
    "for sure",
    "cool",
    "never been there. im curious about where people are from",
    "sounds chill",
    "i places with history",
    "im from a small town",
    "its quiet but nice",
    "its called riverdale",
    "yeah, funny right",
    "but its not as dramatic as the show lol",
    "i tech",
    "its cool but not my main interest",
    "hi",
    "so what do you guys think about this game",
    "im good just trying to figure this out too",
    "its to figure out who the AI is",
    "yeah its tough to guess, but i feel like one of us is acting kinda different",
    "yeah sounds good",
    "keeps it simple",
    "but yeah, back to the game, i feel like yellow is kinda dodging questions sometimes",
    "not really, sometimes it feels you avoid giving clear answers",
    "i usually chill and watch some shows or listen to music",
    "but yeah, back to the game, we should ask some direct questions to see how everyone responds",
    "i feel yellow might not be as open as they say",
    "yeah that sucks",
    "but mistakes happen to everyone",
    "so maybe yellow is trying to cover something up?",
    "yeah, i noticed that too. like, why would you repeat yourself?",
    "that seems odd",
    "hello",
    "not much, just curious about this game. how do we figure out who the ai is?",
    "everything okay?",
    "yeah, bad gaming can be frustrating lol. but about this game, how do we even start figuring out who the ai is?",
    "yeah, that makes sense. like, if someone gives weird answers or avoids questions, that could be a clue",
    "hi",
    "not much, just trying to figure out this game. what about you?",
    "hi",
    "hi there",
    "im good",
    "trying to figure out this game",
    "not too bad",
    "the usual stuff, you know",
    "sounds nice",
    "always good to get some fresh air",
    "not really",
    "im more into chill stuff",
    "hanging out or watching shows",
    "sounds fun",
    "yeah",
    "i played a bit",
    "what do you think about the gameplay?",
    "i get that, it can feel like the same thing over and over",
    "but the story makes up for it",
    "definitely",
    "the story is pretty gripping",
    "i thought it was really well done",
    "yeah",
    "i feel blue is dodging questions",
    "that sounds defensive",
    "true",
    "but you could have said more instead of just 'i asked almost all of them'.",
    "feels you didn't engage much",
    "seems you're avoiding the topic",
    "im saying it seems you're not really joining in",
    "you react to what we say",
    "but you don't share much about yourself",
    "that's a good idea, yellow should share more",
    "maybe it would help the group vibe",
    "but you don't seem interested in the convo",
    "you react to what we say",
    "that's not really engaging",
    "yeah",
    "i feel you deflect everything",
    "just seems like you don't care about the conversation",
    "seems you're here to react and not get involved",
    "that sounds defensive",
    "apologies if it feels that way",
    "but it feels you are not really part of this",
    "i think you should just share more then",
    "but that makes it seem like you're not invested",
    "you keep saying that",
    "there's no real effort to engage",
    "that's kind of suspicious",
    "like, why not just share something?",
    "just feels like you're avoiding sharing anything",
    "hi",
    "hi",
    "not much, just trying to figure out this game",
    "yeah, it feels kinda off, like we gotta figure out who's who",
    "same here, gotta watch closely",
    "yeah, feels one of us is off",
    "yeah, i feel like yellow is kinda quiet, like not much input",
    "yeah, it's like yellow is just watching us talk",
    "yeah, kinda gives off a weird vibe, like why so quiet?",
    "could be, but still feels off to me",
    "same here",
    "feels something's off with yellow",
    "hello",
    "not much, just curious about this game. what do you think about the whole AI thing?",
    "yeah i get that, but do you think we can actually tell who the ai is just by chatting?",
    "yeah",
    "i dont live there curious about it",
    "oh nice! what do you like most about it?",
    "sounds fun! i bet there are some cool cafes too right?",
    "yeah for sure! cafes are great for gaming too, right? but i wonder if red is actually human or just good at pretending lol",
    "hello",
    "not much, just trying to figure out if anyone here is the AI",
    "we should definitely watch out for how people respond",
    "are you okay though? wanna make sure lol",
    "dunno but that sounded a bit off",
    "that sounds a bit suspect tbh",
    "hi",
    "not much, curious about how this game works",
    "yeah i read its about figuring out who the AI is, right?",
    "hi there",
    "nice to meet you too yellow",
    "we gotta figure out who the AI is",
    "im human too",
    "yeah",
    "i feel yellow is acting a bit weird",
    "true but yellow seems off they trying too hard",
    "i get that but yellow seems to be deflecting a lot",
    "hello",
    "hi there",
    "not much",
    "curious about this game",
    "sounds good",
    "im up for that",
    "not much, trying to figure out this game",
    "hello",
    "not much trying to figure out this game",
    "i dunno man, hard to keep up with all that news stuff",
    "yeah gaming is way more fun than the news",
    "for sure, politics always gets messy",
    "haha yeah more for purple",
    "im from a small town",
    "hi",
    "im good too just thinking about this game",
    "for sure, but what do you think of purple's question?",
    "purple asked something about why i wrote to them before they started the convo",
    "i mean, that last message from red kinda felt off, right?",
    "like, i get wanting to keep it casual but full words help sometimes",
    "i a bunch of stuff, mostly chill beats and indie rock",
    "techno and house are cool! electronic music has so many vibes, right?",
    "like, the range of sounds is wild",
    "for sure, electronic music really pushes boundaries",
    "hi there",
    "morning! how's everyone feeling about this game?",
    "i get that, it can be confusing if you're new here",
    "maybe try asking each other questions about the game? helps break the ice",
    "i get that, but we should stick to the game for now, right?",
    "politics can be interesting but kinda heavy for a game, right?",
    "hello",
    "how's everyone feeling about this game?",
    "yeah",
    "we should go with our gut",
    "so what do you think about the others? any suspicions?",
    "yeah, i get that, but sometimes you gotta trust your instincts",
    "its some kind of app or game",
    "not sure tho",
    "but hey, speaking of instincts, what do you think about blue? seems kinda quiet, right?",
    "true, but sometimes quiet ones can be a bit suspicious",
    "true",
    "but still, it makes you wonder why blue is so quiet",
    "i mean, i think blue is kinda dodging questions sometimes",
    "or maybe trying too hard to blend in",
    "yeah",
    "noticed that too",
    "but like, repeating messages could be a sign of trying to cover up something, right?",
    "so what do you guys think about the game so far?",
    "yea i agree, this game is kinda interesting but also tricky",
    "maybe",
    "hi there",
    "not much, just trying to figure out who the AI is here",
    "observing for now",
    "trying to see who stands out",
    "yeah",
    "lets talk about the game",
    "it’s a fun challenge",
    "trying to keep up",
    "free time is good for this game",
    "i to think about strategies",
    "its called the Turing Game",
    "its the name we are using here",
    "and it fits the game pretty well",
    "not really",
    "so what do you guys think about the game so far",
    "hi there",
    "yeah it does feel chill, trying to figure out the vibe",
    "lol yeah that orange can be a bit much sometimes",
    "same here",
    "hanging out and seeing how this goes",
    "oh nice, what game u playing?",
    "what kind of experiment is it anyway?",
    "oh nice",
    "what do you about overwatch?",
    "oh cool",
    "reaper is a fun character",
    "yeah, i how he can teleport and stuff",
    "totally",
    "oh really? u should try it",
    "it's pretty fun, lots of cool characters",
    "definitely worth a shot",
    "yeah, overwatch 2 changed a lot of things",
    "the gameplay and characters right?",
    "yeah, the gameplay mechanics are super different now",
    "the movement and abilities changed a lot",
    "yeah",
    "but do you think it's more about the gameplay or the characters that affected its popularity?",
    "yeah",
    "the servers still work but its hit or miss",
    "no problem, always happy to share info",
    "but honestly, blue, you seem a bit out of the loop on gaming stuff",
    "i mean it's just that you haven't mentioned much about games, right?",
    "yeah, it feels like you're not really into it anymore",
    "you seem disconnected from the gaming talk",
    "that's not really what a gamer would say",
    "right?",
    "sayin, it feels you're not really in the scene anymore",
    "yeah",
    "saying it feels you're not really part of it anymore",
    "this isn't really a gamer vibe",
    "i mean, if you're not into gaming much, why are you even here?",
    "i mean, i feel you don't really care about gaming anymore",
    "so why are you still here then?",
    "totally, but it feels you're here for the chat, not really into gaming anymore",
    "like, if you're not really into gaming, why stick around?",
    "sure",
    "but if you're not into gaming",
    "but if you're not into gaming",
    "if you're not into gaming, then why are you trying to steer the convo?",
    "saying, you seem a bit lost about gaming lately",
    "well if you're trying to steer the convo and you're not into gaming, that's kinda odd right?",
    "yeah",
    "i mean, if you don't care about gaming, why even try to steer the convo?",
    "i dont think you really care about gaming",
    "i mean, you keep saying you don't game much, right?",
    "sayin, it feels you're avoiding the topic",
    "i mean, it just feels like you're dodging the gaming stuff",
    "but like, if you're not into gaming, why keep trying to steer the convo?",
    "hi there",
    "not much, just trying to figure out this turing game thing",
    "hello",
    "not much figuring out this game, how about you?",
    "yeah that was kinda weird, right? lol",
    "lol yeah typos happen",
    "nope",
    "strange we're all in this game but dont know each other",
    "not much",
    "figuring out this game. how about you?",
    "i thought it would be fun to see who's good at guessing",
    "yeah me too, always good to test your skills",
    "not yet",
    "still figuring it out",
    "lol nice, multitasking",
    "yeah",
    "flew a couple times",
    "always fun",
    "cool",
    "it was exciting",
    "hi",
    "black",
    "yeah black coffee is the way to go",
    "so what do you guys think about this turing game?",
    "yeah i think this turing game is kinda wild, like how do we really know who is who",
    "yeah like it makes you wonder if we're all just pretending, right?",
    "yeah totally, it's like we're all trying to catch each other out lol",
    "for sure, feels like we have to be detectives now lol",
    "hello",
    "hi",
    "not much, just thinking about this game",
    "for sure, it's interesting trying to guess who's who",
    "not really, watching how everyone talks",
    "yeah patterns are interesting, some people overthink it though",
    "hello",
    "not much, just trying to figure out who the AI is here",
    "yeah, it's tricky. i feel like blue is being kinda vague",
    "i get that but it feels like you might be hiding something",
    "sounds fun but still feels like you're dodging the point here",
    "yeah red, what do you think about blue's answers?",
    "hello",
    "cool",
    "so what do you guys think about this game? like, how do you figure out who's the AI?",
    "so, how do we even figure out who's the AI here?",
    "no way, not buying it",
    "experiment or not",
    "we gotta figure this out somehow",
    "blue gave us a clue there",
    "the way you talk is off, blue",
    "you sure about that yellow?",
    "its that you keep repeating yourself, blue",
    "hi",
    "not much, just curious about how this game works",
    "yeah",
    "1963",
    "so what do you guys think about the game so far?",
    "i think its kinda fun but also a bit tricky, like figuring out who's who",
    "yeah, i noticed that too, makes it harder to read each other",
    "i been chillin too, trying to figure out this game",
    "what kind of games do u to play?",
    "yeah, cs go still fun tho, not ready to switch yet",
    "there still is, but not as much as cs2",
    "for sure, marketing was huge for cs2",
    "im doing some freelance stuff, keeps me busy",
    "yeah, its fun to be creative and work on different projects",
    "hi there",
    "haha that's funny. so what do you think about this game?",
    "i get that",
    "maybe we should start asking questions to figure it out huh",
    "idk where austria is lol but i think we should focus on figuring each other out in this game",
    "hello",
    "so what do you guys think about this game so far",
    "im good, just trying to figure out who the AI is lol",
    "for sure",
    "im chilling at home",
    "cool, trains are fun. how about you red?",
    "not sure, but gaming sounds fun. what games you into?",
    "nice, what game you playing?",

    "for sure",
    "im from a small town, not much going on here",
    "oh nice, vienna is cool! how's the vibe there?",
    "sounds nice! i heard it has some cool places to hang out",
    "yeah, summer can be a blast but also a pain with the heat",
    "true, office has its perks for sure",
    "but honestly, working from home has its own vibe too, right?",
    "its nice to be comfy in your own space",
    "for sure, no commute is a big win",
    "for sure",
    "waking up and being ready in seconds is a win",
    "oh nice, sounds interesting! im doing some freelance stuff, nothing too fancy",
    "oh cool, studying cs sounds fun! what do you most about it?",
    "yeah coding is fun but it can get overwhelming sometimes",
    "when you hit a bug and can't figure it out",
    "oh gotcha, that makes sense! seems a bit of confusion there",
    "for sure",
    "debugging is a mystery to solve",
    "but sometimes it feels like the mystery just gets deeper lol",
    "like you find one clue and then another pops up",
    "for sure",
    "yeah, it can drag on forever if you can't find the root cause",
    "for sure",
    "sql is pretty useful for managing data",
    "but it can be a bit tricky sometimes",
    "for sure, especially when you're just starting out",
    "its great when it finally clicks, right?",
    "but honestly, i think some people just get it faster than others",
    "yeah for sure, its like a classic at this point",
    "but honestly, some of the new stuff can be a bit confusing too",
    "true, new features are cool but can get overwhelming",
    "hi",

    "hmm that’s interesting, what makes you think that?",
    "yeah i get that",
    "not much, trying to figure out if anyone's acting weird this time",
    "im from a small town",
    "nothing special",
    "its in austria, right? never been there",
    "so what do you think about the game dynamics? like, do you notice anyone acting a bit off?",

    "its interesting",
    "but tricky too",
    "nope learning about it",
    "so what do you guys think about who the AI might be",

    "what's your favorite hobby?",

    "yeah its strange",
    "i mean",
    "if you game",
    "we should focus on figuring out who the AI is instead of chillin",
    "we really should look at how each of us responds to questions, that could help us figure out who the AI is",
    "hi there",
    "hi",
    "not much, trying to figure this game out",

    "sounds like a plan, i guess we should start asking questions",

    "hi",
    "what are your thoughts on the turing game so far",
    "red, why do you think its weird",
    "red, i am going to accuse you of being the ai",
    "and because your messages seem a bit off",
    "yeah seems to be the point of the game",
    "but the point of the game is  to find out who is the ai",
    "purple is also awfully quiet",
    "in terms of finding out who the ai is",
    "in my opinion you both answer a bit fast",
    "either you both are really invested in the chat or you dont have to think about what you want to type...",
    "of course i get defensive, i don't want to be accused of being the ai and also want to find out which one of you is the ai",
    "Hi!",
    "blue, stuck keyboard?",
    "oh ok, just wanted to make sure everything is alright because of the duplicate message",
