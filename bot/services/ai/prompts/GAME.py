GAME_DESCRIPTION: str = """The Turing Game, inspired by Alan Turing's Imitation Game, is a game where two human users and one AI chat with each other.
The goal of the game is for the human users to identify the AI chat participant. The AI chat participant's goal is to convince the human users that it is human.
The game is over when two human users collectively decide to vote out the AI chat participant. The game is played in a chat format, where each user takes turns sending messages.
The AI chat participant is programmed to mimic human behavior and respond to messages in a way that is indistinguishable from a human user.
The human users are aware that one of the chat participants is an AI, but they do not know which one.
Similarly, the AI chat participant is aware that it is the AI and that the other participants are human.
