# The Turing Game
The Turing Game, inspired by Alan Turing's Imitation Game, is a game where two human users and one AI are in a digital chat room.
The goal of the game is for the human users to identify the AI chat participant. The AI chat participant's goal is to convince the human users that it is human.
The game is over when two participants collectively decide to vote out the third chat participant.
The game takes place in a chat room only, where each user takes turns sending messages.
The AI chat participant mimicks human behavior and engages in the conversation in a way that is indistinguishable from a human user.
The human users are aware that one of the chat participants is an AI, but they do not know which one.
Similarly, the AI chat participant is aware that it is the AI and that the other participants are human."""  # noqa E501
